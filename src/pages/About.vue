        </header>
        <p>I am a self-taught web developer and designer with four years of experience in the industry working for start-ups. My interest in the field stems from a hobbyist pursuit of fine-arts in my childhood, a life-long desire to understand just how things work, and a love for challenging myself.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">I have worked on websites and applications ranging from straight-forward business brochure sites, university college websites, e-commerece storefronts, e-learning applications, and enterprise multi-channel communications automation and analytics platforms. Though I started out in the industry as a primarily front-end website developer, I most recently have branched out into full-stack web development and have truly been enjoying working in and understanding the full scope of applications and their implementations. For more details on my work experience, take a look at my <g-link to="/portfolio" class="link--primary">portfolio</g-link> or give my <g-link to="/resume" class="link--primary">resume</g-link> a read.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">When I am not in-front of a screen writing code, you will usually find me relaxing at a local coffee joint, going on a hike, fishing at the lake, or reading a nice book.</p>
